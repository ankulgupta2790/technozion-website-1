They have to rearrange the code blocks such that game would function smoothly.\nThe smoother and faster they arrange the blocks in the correct order, the better the game will perform, and higher points will be awarded.\n\nLeaderboard: For the Snake Game, we\u2019ll consider how fast the participants solve the puzzle and how smoothly their snake moves. The quicker they organize the code, the higher they\u2019ll rank on the Leaderboard.\n\nGame 2: Robot Asteroid Game\n\nObjective: This game is about controlling a robot that has to survive as long as possible in a space full of asteroids.\n\nHow It Works:\nParticipants will control a robot, with options to move in different directions (upward, backward, left, and right) every 6-7 seconds.\nThese directional commands will be executed in a for loop, meaning participants must input directions carefully to avoid asteroids. The directions they choose will continuously run in a 'for loop,' requiring precise timing and logic to survive.\nWe\u2019ll have the option for solo play and for 3-4 players at a time. In multiplayer mode, other participants can generate fireballs or obstacles to increase the challenge for the robots!\nThe longer a robot survives and avoids asteroids, the higher the player\u2019s score.\n\nLeaderboard: For the Robot Game, the leaderboard will track how long each robot survives and how well participants dodge asteroids.
